    <h3> In this page I would like to share a bit more about myself.</h3>
    <p> In highschool I took 1 coding class. I really struggled to pay attention and do well. 
        Overall in highschool I did very well. However I thought that codeing would have little to no imapact on my life. I was wrong. 
        I now have learned so much more than I ever thought I would in this class IS 201.</p>

        <p> I served in the Nicaragua Managua North Mission. I loved it so much. I learned so much about myself and about others. As I saw the people of Nicaragua I learned how to love them
            and to love myself. I learned the power that Jesus has. My mission truely had a massive imact on my life. I am so blessed.
